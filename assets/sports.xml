  <info>Pele is the most iconic footballer of the twentieth Century. He epitomised the flair, joy and passion the Brazilians bought to the game.

		Pele’s career spanned throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

		In his early career, the young and unknown Pele helped inspire Brazil to victory in the 1958 World Cup. In 1962, Brazil retained the World Cup. In 1966, Brazil were hot favourites, but, lost out to the home nation England.

		His crowing glory was the Brazilian victory in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. In this world cup, some of the football played by Brazil and Pele was widely considered to the greatest in the history of the game. Brazil won the final 4-1 against Italy; it was a genuine advertisement for the ‘beautiful game’ and a fitting pinnacle of Pele’s international career.

		Pele went on to score over 1,000 goals in professional games. (The 1000th goal coming as a penalty in the US league sparking celebrations around the world). His strike rate in international games was one of the highest ever. In 92 appearances, he scored 77 goals.

  <info>Muhammad Ali was one of America’s greatest 20th century boxers and athletes. Muhammad Ali was born Cassius Clay in Louisville, Kentucky. He started fighting at the age of 12 after his bicycle was stolen. Under the guidance of Joe Martin, Clay became an explosive boxer and won six Kentucky Gold Gloves during high school. In 1960, Clay won a gold medal in the Olympics at Rome, Italy.
  
		In 1965, Clay joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. Ali defended his championship for the next several years, winning many matches with a breathtaking combination of speed and power. In 1967, however Ali was stripped of his championship for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War. Ali immediately became a controversial figure, and was the subject of outrage for many Americans. Although Ali lost his title to Joe Frazier in 1971, he cemented his title as “The Greatest” by outdueling George Foreman in 1974 in “The Rumble in the Jungle”. In 1975, Ali defeated Joe Frazier in “The Thrilla in Manila”. In one of the best fights in boxing history, Ali won by TKO after the 14th round. In 1981, Ali retired with a career record of 56-5, with 37 knockouts.

Born into a middle-class family in Haryana he became interested in cricket at a young age. He played for the Haryana cricket team at the beginning of his career eventually making his way into the national team, thanks to his aggressive play and high energy level. He cemented his place in the Indian team with his impressive performances and was soon made the captain. It was under his leadership that India went on to win the 1983 World Cup in spite of being the underdogs.
